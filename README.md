The `models/` folder stores all the trained models. After training, models will be saved here for later use in evaluation or production deployment.

### `notebooks/`
All Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb` files) are kept in the `notebooks/` folder. These may include exploratory data analysis, model training workflows, and other experimental tasks.

### `README.md`
This markdown file (you are reading it now) provides an overview of the project, directory structure, and instructions for usage. It also explains how to train the model or deploy it in a production environment.
